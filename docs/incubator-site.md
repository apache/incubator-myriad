## Incubator Site Help

Site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyll.rb) to generate a static site from html and markdown files..

Generate an updated site by using `jekyll build`

The generated files to be uploaded to the webserver are in the `_site\` directory.

New posts and announcements can be created as markdown in the `_posts\` directory.

## TODO

* Limit # of posts displayed on front page
* Settle on topic labels within posts for easy filerting on site. (e.g. news, release, blog, events)
* Create pages / areas within news page to view posts filtered by topic.
* Finalize permalink and offer them out.
