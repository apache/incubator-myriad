/**
 * Concrete implementation of an ExecutorDriver that connects an
 * Executor with a Mesos slave. The MesosExecutorDriver is
 * thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The driver is responsible for invoking the Executor callbacks as it
 * communicates with the Mesos slave.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that blocking on the MesosExecutorDriver (e.g., via {@link
 * #join}) doesn't affect the executor callbacks in anyway because
 * they are handled by a different thread.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the driver uses GLOG to do its own logging. GLOG flags can
 * be set via environment variables, prefixing the flag name with
 * "GLOG_", e.g., "GLOG_v=1". For Mesos specific logging flags see
 * src/logging/flags.hpp. Mesos flags can also be set via environment
 * variables, prefixing the flag name with "MESOS_", e.g.,
 * "MESOS_QUIET=1".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See src/examples/java/TestExecutor.java for an example of using the
 * MesosExecutorDriver.
