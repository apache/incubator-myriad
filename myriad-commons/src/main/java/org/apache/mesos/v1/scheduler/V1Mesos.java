/**
 * Concrete implementation of the Mesos interface that connects a Scheduler
 * with a Mesos master. This class is thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses the scheduler library (src/scheduler/scheduler.cpp)
 * based on the V1 Mesos Scheduler API. The library is responsible for
 * invoking the Scheduler callbacks as it communicates with the Mesos master.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the scheduler library uses GLOG to do its own logging. GLOG flags
 * can be set via environment variables, prefixing the flag name with
 * "GLOG_", e.g., "GLOG_v=1". For Mesos specific logging flags see
 * src/logging/flags.hpp. Mesos flags can also be set via environment
 * variables, prefixing the flag name with "MESOS_", e.g., "MESOS_QUIET=1".
 * <p>
 * See src/examples/java/V1TestFramework.java for an example of using this.
