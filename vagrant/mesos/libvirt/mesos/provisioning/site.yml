# - Plays are map roles to hosts.  
# - Roles are just abstractions around tasks
# - Each "hosts:"-block (a play) will be executed 
#   one by one. So you can use multiple
#   blocks to force the desired execution order.
# - The plays are executed from top to down order.
# - Multiple roles declarations per play are executed
#   non in special order, you cannot control the order
#   of roles within a play.
