# Development Testbed based on Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments, sandboxed in
a virtual machine. Vagrant is a Swiss Army knife for development environments.
It does everything you need to create and manage them, and helps enforce good
practices by encouraging the use of automation and an environment that more
closely resembles production.
