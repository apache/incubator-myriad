blurb: "Myriad codebase has been migrated from Github to Apache's git infrastructure."
---
The final legal hurdles to finally donating the codebase to the Apache Software Foundation have been overcome.
(Thanks EBay and PayPal!) The codebase now resides in the Apache git infrastructure. Please clone this and use
it from now on. The old github repo is now no longer used, however pull requests may still be submitted through the official Apache Github mirror.
