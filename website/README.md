# Apache Myriad Website

This is the source for the Apache Myriad [site](http://myriad.incubator.apache.org). The site is a [Jekyll](http://jekyll.rb) blog with [Material Design Lite] (http://www.getmdl.io/) for the look and feel.

## Generating Site Files

The site static files are generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyll.rb). Jekyll is a ruby gem that compiles markdown and templates into static HTML pages. To build the site, install Jekyll on your system as explained [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once Jekyll is installed, the site can be generated by running `jekyll build` from the `website/` directory.

The static site files will be placed in `website/_site`

To test the site, run `jekyll serve` and open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a browser.

## Deploying Site Files

The website files are stored in SVN at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/myriad/site

Once generated, copy the `website/_site` files into this svn repo and commit to svn.

The Apache infrastructure runs svnpubsub to sync this repo with the webserver serving http://myriad.incubator.apache.org

## Adding content

The Jekyll website is a great resource and you should read through it. For the impatient though, create a markdown file in `website/_posts` modeled after one already there. Then `jekyll build` and the new post will be linked on the front page and generated in the news page.
