    Deploy Apache YARN Applications Using Apache Mesos
    Apache Myriad enables the co-existence of Apache Hadoop and Apache Mesos
    on the same physical infrastructure. By running Hadoop YARN as a Mesos
    framework, YARN applications and Mesos frameworks can run side-by-side,
    dynamically sharing cluster resources.
